# EC VSV

The Ice Hockey Club Villacher Sportverein (short EC VSV) is an Austrian ice hockey team from Villach in the state of Carinthia, competing in the ICE Hockey League. Home games are held at the Villach Arena (approximately 4,500 seats). VSV has won the Austrian championship title six times (1981, 1992, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2006). The Villach team colors are blue and white, and the logo features an eagle, which has earned the team the nickname "The Eagles."

## History

### Rise to the Bundesliga and Initial Success
With the victory in the second division championship in the 1976/77 season, EC VSV took advantage of the promotion to the top league, where they have remained ever since, making them the second oldest Bundesliga participant after EC KAC. Although the team finished last in its debut season under coach Karol Havasi (who did not complete the season and was replaced by player-coach Ryan D’Arcy), some young players, notably Leo Sivec, showed promising performances. The second season saw a fifth-place finish, with the main challenge being the vacant coaching position, initially filled by Adelbert St. John and later by the injured Bart Crashley toward season's end.

### First Championship
After failing to reach the championship round in their first three attempts, the 1980/81 season finally brought success. Thanks to youth training under Hermann Knoll and the inclusion of young players (with Sivec, the oldest local player, being just 23 years old), EC VSV reached second place in the regular season and narrowly won the championship round over Wiener EV. The following year, however, Sivec missed most of the season due to injury, and fitness issues led to a disappointing fifth-place finish in both the regular season and championship rounds.

Sivec’s injury struggles continued in the 1982/83 season. Additionally, international player Douglas Palazzari fell short of expectations and was replaced by goalie Marcel Sakac, who was brought in to stabilize the defense. While integrating more young players showed promise, the season did not bring success. However, this development paid off the following year when six VSV players were selected by coach Rudolf Killias for the Austrian national ice hockey team. The team’s problem of inconsistency persisted in subsequent years, though it continued to produce outstanding local talent. In the 1991/92 season, VSV won the championship again, winning all playoff games. This achievement was repeated the following year.

### The 1990s
In the last decade of the 20th century, EC VSV managed to build on past successes with good placements, though without securing the ultimate prize. During this period, VEU Feldkirch dominated Austrian ice hockey, and VSV was occasionally eliminated by local rival EC KAC in the playoffs. It wasn’t until the 1998/99 season that Villach overcame Klagenfurt in the finals to claim their fourth championship.

### The New Millennium
In the millennium season and the following year, the tables turned once again. EC VSV lost in the finals to KAC twice in a row (1:4 and 2:4 series). In the 2001/02 season, the teams met in the semifinals, where VSV emerged victorious and subsequently defeated EHC Linz in the final to secure their fifth championship. This season also marked the debut of goalie Gert Prohaska with EC VSV, who left KAC due to limited prospects and has since become a key figure for the team.

In the 2002/03 season, the team reached the finals again but lost to Linz, and the following year they had to settle for the runner-up title against KAC once more. The 2004/05 season began poorly, and it soon became evident that Blair McDonald, who had replaced Greg Holst as coach, was not a good fit. After an 8:11 home loss to newcomer and last-place EC Red Bull Salzburg, McDonald was dismissed, and Holst returned. Additionally, with the NHL season on hold due to a lockout, the team was bolstered by NHL players Ethan Moreau (Edmonton Oilers), Jason Krog (Mighty Ducks of Anaheim), Eric Weinrich (St. Louis Blues), and Reinhard Divis (St. Louis Blues). Although performances improved and VSV narrowly secured a playoff spot (ranking ahead of EC Graz 99ers due to a better head-to-head record despite equal points), the season ended with three semifinal losses to eventual champion Vienna Capitals.

### Sixth Championship and Derby Record Wins
In the 2005/06 season, key players were replaced, and Greg Holst continued as head coach. After dominating the regular season alongside Red Bulls Salzburg, the two teams met in the finals as expected. VSV claimed their sixth and most recent championship with a 4:2 series win. Dany Bousquet was the standout player of the 2005/06 championship season, leading the league in goals (47) and points (86). His most significant contribution was scoring the decisive goal in the sixth final game against Red Bulls Salzburg in the 78th minute, securing both the game and the championship for VSV. Goalie Gert Prohaska ranked first in goaltending with a 92.85% save rate.

On February 20, 2007, the longest winning streak in the Carinthian ice hockey derby came to an end. Between February 18, 2005, and January 21, 2007, EC VSV won 17 consecutive games, preventing EC KAC from winning against Villach for almost two years. On March 15, VSV began the playoff semifinals against third-place Black Wings Linz with a home game, winning the series (best-of-five) 3:0 (7:4, 4:3 in a shootout, 4:3) and advanced to the finals to face Red Bulls Salzburg. The best-of-seven series ended with a 4:1 win for the Red Bulls Salzburg (0:2, 4:3 in a shootout, 3:6, 0:3, 2:4).

### 2007 to 2015
The 2007/08 Erste Bank Ice Hockey League season was mixed for the traditional Carinthian club. As the only team in the league association, VSV played through the season without any player exchanges and successfully integrated several young players from Villach into the main roster. Their sporting success was limited to reaching the quarterfinals, where they concluded the 2007/08 season on February 24 with a 3:0 away defeat against eventual Austrian EBEL champion EC Red Bull Salzburg, cheered on by approximately 1,000 traveling fans. Longtime Villach coach Greg Holst announced his departure from Villach before the last playoff game. Larry Huras took over as coach. Several key players from previous seasons were also replaced, although the club’s tight financial situation limited notable new signings. The season ended early with an elimination in the quarterfinals.

In the 2009/10 season, Johan Strömwall took over as head coach. Several players were exchanged again, and a solid summer training led the team to five straight wins and an early lead in the standings. As the regular season progressed, EC VSV fell into the middle ranks. Although the foreign players often lacked the necessary quality, the local players compensated for it to a large extent. A fifth-place finish in the regular season was a noteworthy achievement, given the team’s limited budget for roster improvements. However, the season ended once again in the quarterfinals, with EC VSV losing 1:4 in the series to EHC Linz.

The 2010/11 season followed a similar trajectory, with a strong start to the season but a performance slump near the end of the regular season, which culminated in February 2011 with the dismissal of coach Strömwall. Former assistant coach and longtime VSV player Michael Stewart took over and led the team to a 4:1 quarterfinal series win over EHC Linz, advancing to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by local rival EC KAC. The playoffs also marked the final appearance of Gert Prohaska in the Villach goal, as he retired after a decade with VSV. In the summer of 2011, several key players from the club’s youth program, such as Michael Raffl and Andreas Kristler, left, necessitating an extensive roster overhaul.

The most important change for VSV in the 2012/13 season was the appointment of Finnish coach Hannu Järvenpää from league rival Olimpija Ljubljana. With Derek Ryan and John Hughes ranking second and third in scoring league-wide and Jean-Philippe Lamoureux as one of the top goaltenders in the EBEL, VSV finished the regular season in fourth place but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by EHC Linz.

Before the 2013/14 season, players such as Michael Forney and Brock McBride joined the team. Once again, VSV secured a direct playoff spot by finishing sixth in the regular season, with Derek Ryan and John Hughes again among the league’s top scorers. They defeated the Vienna Capitals 4:1 in the quarterfinals but fell to the eventual league champion Bolzano with a 1:3 loss in the semifinals. The season’s end brought significant roster changes, with John Hughes dismissed for repeated disciplinary issues. Other players like Scott Hotham, Derek Ryan, and Markus Peintner also left, and replacements included John Lammers, François Fortier, and Geoff Waugh.

In the 2014/15 season, VSV achieved third place in the regular season, with Jean-Philippe Lamoureux recognized as the league’s top goaltender. Despite a strong showing, Salzburg defeated VSV in the quarterfinals after five games (4:1 in the series), with two of the encounters decided in overtime. The fourth game set a league record for the longest game, ending in triple overtime at 111:39 minutes with a goal by John Hughes, now playing for Salzburg.

### 2015–2017
After a poor start to the 2015/16 season, marked by a 1:4 loss against bottom-ranked Ljubljana, the club’s management responded by replacing the head coach, bringing back Greg Holst in November 2015 after seven years. Under Holst’s leadership, Villach improved significantly, including a streak of nine consecutive wins between December 15 and January 3. Despite only achieving seventh place in the regular season, Villach dominated the qualification round with eight wins and two losses. In the quarterfinals, they faced Vienna Capitals, winning the series 4:1, with three of the games going into overtime. Dustin Johner scored the decisive overtime goal in the fifth game to secure the semifinal spot. They then faced reigning champion Salzburg, who won the series 4:2.

In the 2016/17 season, VSV retained many of its young homegrown players, while goaltender Jean-Philippe Lamoureux left for the Vienna Capitals and was replaced by Olivier Roy. Top scorer Žiga Pance signed with rival KAC, and leading goal-scorer Rick Schofield joined EHC Linz. New signings included Sam Labrecque, Kevin Wehrs, Evan McGrath, Corey Locke, and Jan Urbas. In August 2016, the necessary GmbH (limited liability company) for professional hockey operations was established, overseen by a consulting group of friends of Villach hockey. Giuseppe Mion became the sole managing director, and General Manager Stefan Widitsch took on the role of authorized officer. The club remains the de facto owner of the GmbH; Mion continues as club president, and Treasurer Reinhard Grüner handles the finances.

In November 2016, Olivier Latendresse and Jérémie Blain joined to replace departing players Brock McBride and Mikko Jokela. Former commentator Philipp Pinter was briefly signed for 14 games after a series of injuries, with up to eight players unavailable simultaneously. Villach finished the regular season in seventh place, just behind EC KAC, and entered the qualification round. In January 2017, René Swette replaced Olivier Roy, who was injured in the first qualification game. Villach started with the maximum six bonus points in the qualification round but lost six of their first eight games, missing the playoffs for the first time since the 2011/12 season.

### Rebuilding and Multiple Coaching Changes (since 2017)
Following the early exit in the previous season, Giuseppe Mion announced “major changes,” with a significant portion of the foreign and some local players not receiving new contract offers, and captain Eric Hunter retiring. The top scorers from the 2016/17 season, Jan Urbas and Corey Locke, left for better offers from competitors.

With the signing of David Kickert and the contract extension for Lukas Herzog, VSV entered the 2017/18 season with an all-Austrian goalie duo. The offense was reinforced with Kyle Beach and Nikolas Petrik, brother of VSV forward Benjamin Petrik. Other new forwards included Jordan Hickmott and Andrew Sarauer, who joined from Fehérvár. On December 3, 2017, head coach Greg Holst was released following a loss to HC Innsbruck due to poor performance. Assistant coach Markus Peintner took over as head coach.

In the 2018/19 season, Gerhard Unterluggauer was hired as head coach, with Markus Peintner returning as assistant coach. Villach-based company Panaceo became the new title sponsor. After an unsuccessful 2018/19 season, most of the roster was changed. Gerhard Unterluggauer and Markus Peintner were dismissed, with Jyrki Aho hired as head coach and Sakari Lindfors as assistant coach.

Despite a strong start to the 2019/20 season, performance declined towards the end of the regular season, prompting the board to dismiss head coach Jyrki Aho. Rob Daum was appointed as his successor, and the team finished first in the qualification round. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the early end of the season after three playoff games. The sponsorship contract with Panaceo was not renewed, and in September 2020, GRAND Immobilien took over as the club’s title sponsor.

For the 2020/21 season, Dan Ceman was appointed as head coach. After a slow start, Ceman was replaced by Rob Daum in December 2020. Although only able to secure tenth place in the regular season, VSV reached the playoffs by finishing third in the qualification round. There, they faced local rival EC KAC, losing 4:1 in the quarterfinals. Rob Daum continued as head coach. The 2021/22 season was the first in which Rob Daum served as VSV’s head coach throughout. A strong second half saw VSV finish second in the regular season, securing a direct playoff berth. In the quarterfinals, they defeated HK Olimpija Ljubljana 4:3, but they fell 1:4 to Fehérvár AV19 in the semifinals.

In September 2023, VSV celebrated its 100th anniversary with a gala, where Peter Raffl was honored as the "Player of the Century," and the jersey numbers of six former VSV players were retired.
